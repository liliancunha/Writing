	abstract = {Using data of three well observed Type II plateau supernovae (SNe II-P), SNe 1987A, 1999em, and 2003hn, and two atmosphere models by Eastman et al. and Dessart \& Hillier, we derive calibrations for bolometric corrections and effective temperature from BVI photometry. The typical scatter of the bolometric correction is 0.11 mag. With these results we obtain bolometric light curves and effective temperature evolution for a sample of 33 SNe II-P. The SN sample shows a range of 1 dex in plateau luminosity and plateau durations from 75 to 120 days. Comparing the shape of the transition between the plateau and the radioactive tail, we find that the size of the drop is in the range of 0.8-1.12 dex.},

	abstract = {We present spectroscopic and photometric observations of the peculiar Type II supernova (SN) 1998A. The light curves and spectra closely resemble those of SN 1987A, suggesting that the SN 1998A progenitor exploded when it was a compact blue supergiant. However, the comparison with SN 1987A also highlights some important differences: SN 1998A is more luminous and the spectra show bluer continua and larger expansion velocities at all epochs. These observational properties indicate that the explosion of SN 1998A is more energetic than SN 1987A and more typical of Type II supernovae. Comparing the observational data with simulations, we deduce that the progenitor of SN 1998A was a massive star ({\textasciitilde}25 Msolar) with a small pre-supernova radius ({\textless}{\textasciitilde}6 Ã— 1012 cm). The BaII lines, unusually strong in SN
1987A and some faint II-P events, are almost normal in the case of SN 1998A, indicating that the temperature plays a key role in determining their strength.},

	abstract = {White dwarf models are calculated for the explosions and light curves of Type I supernovae using full hydrodynamics and radiative diffusion. Comparison is made to recent observations. The models are based on the instantaneous thermonuclear burning of part or all of a degenerate carbon/oxygen/helium core. The Rayleigh-Taylor instability at the points of density/composition discontinuity is explored. The effects of radioactive decay of 56Ni and 56Co are
incorporated by means of an absorption treatment of gamma-rays. It is concluded that despite the qualitative appeal of the picture in which binary mass accretion raises a carbon-oxygen white dwarf to the
Chandrasekhar limit, the demand to produce supernovae of the observed characteristics is not easily reconciled quantitatively with current calculations of hydrogen accretion.},
