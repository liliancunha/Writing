Due to the ability to provide full-range distance information at high frame-rates, ToF sensors achieve a significant impact onto current research areas like online object recognition, collision prevention or scene and object reconstruction. Nevertheless, ToF-cameras like the Photonic Mixer Device (PMD) still exhibit a number of error sources that affect the accuracy of measured distance information. For this reason, major error sources for ToF-cameras will be discussed, along with a new calibration approach that combines intrinsic, distance as well as a reflectivity related error calibration in an overall, easy to use system and thus significantly reduces the number of necessary reference images. The main contribution, in this context, is a new intensity-based calibration model that requires less input data compared to other models and thus significantly contributes to the reduction of calibration data.},

	abstract = {The recovery of objects obscured by scattering is an important goal in imaging and has been approached by exploiting, for example, coherence properties, ballistic photons or penetrating wavelengths. Common methods use scattered light transmitted through an occluding material, although these fail if the occluder is opaque. Light is scattered not only by transmission through objects, but also by multiple reflection from diffuse surfaces in a scene. This reflected light contains information about the scene that becomes mixed by the diffuse reflections before reaching the image sensor. This mixing is difficult to decode using traditional cameras. Here we report the combination of a time-of-flight technique and computational reconstruction algorithms to untangle image information mixed by diffuse reflection. We demonstrate a three-dimensional range camera able to look around a corner using diffusely reflected light that achieves sub-millimetre depth precision and centimetre lateral precision over 40 cm×40 cm×40 cm of hidden space.

Unfortunately, research in transient imaging has so far been hindered by the high cost of the required instrumentation, as well as the fragility and difficulty to operate and calibrate devices such as femtosecond lasers and streak cameras. In this paper, we explore the use of photonic mixer devices (PMD), commonly used in inexpensive time-of-flight cameras, as alternative instrumentation for transient imaging. We obtain a sequence of differently modulated images with a PMD sensor, impose a model for local light/object interaction, and use an optimization procedure to infer transient images given the measurements and model. The resulting method produces transient images at a cost several orders of magnitude below existing methods, while simultaneously simplifying and speeding up the capture process.},

	abstract = {Computer vision researchers have long sought video rate sensors which return a channel of depth, in addition to color. One promising technology to make this possible is based on a projector-camera pair that generate shuttered pulses of light. Commercial implementations of the hardware technology are available today. Unfortunately, the software models that allow recovery of depth measurements suffer from relatively high noise and bias. This paper describes a mathematical recovery model for this class of shuttered sensors. The model is useful for understanding the behavior of these sensors, and is validated against empirical data. Based on our model, we introduce two specific methods for improving the quality of recovered depth. Multi-intensity estimation makes use of several observations with varying lamp intensities, and double shuttering suggests that improved performance can be obtained using two shutters instead of one.},

	abstract = {Range imaging has become a critical component of many computer vision applications. The quality of the depth data is of critical importance, but so is the need for speed. Shuttered light-pulse (SLP) imaging uses active illumination hardware to provide high quality depth maps at video frame rates. Unfortunately, current analytical models for deriving depth from SLP imagers are specific to the number of shutters and have a number of deficiencies. As a result, depth estimation often suffers from bias due to object reflectivity, incorrect shutter settings, or strong ambient illumination such as that encountered outdoors. These limitations make SLP imaging unsuitable for many applications requiring stable depth readings. This paper introduces a method that is general to any number of shutters. Using three shutters, the new method produces invariant estimates under changes in ambient illumination, producing high quality depth maps in a wider range of situations.},

	abstract = {This paper presents first hardware implementation and investigations of a new electro-optic modulator (EOM), called the Photonic Mixer Device (PMD). The PMD is a semiconductor device combining the characteristics of fast optical sensing and modulation. Arranged to a PMD-matrix it looks like a CCD-matrix but additionally provides the depth information of each image pixel using an appropriately modulated scene illumination. Besides this feature of 3D- imaging by means of time-related correlation the PMD-chip will enable on-chip 2D-image processing by means of spatial correlation. The principle of operation of the PMD, possible technologies for realization, facilities and applications will be described. This new device offers high potential for optical sensory systems due to an amazingly simple and powerful procedure of electro-optical mixing and correlation. Both CCD and CMOS are appropriate technologies. The latter will be treated in detail as a single-element Photonic Mixer Device. Here we propose several architectures--including two quadrant (2Q)-PMDs--with readout and preprocessing circuits for both, the phase resp, time-of-flight values and the pixel intensities. Arranging PMD-pixels to a PMD-line or to a PMD-matrix will provide a new generation of flexible and powerful solid-state 3D- cameras based on time-of-flight. According to the EOM- principle, the proposed 2D-mixer requires no additional optical devices, no broadband electronic amplifiers and mixers. This solid-state PMD-array offers even more unique facilities, e.g., performing high speed spatial light modulation up to the GHz range or optical CDMA- communication. The modulation characteristic of the PMD is an important aspect of this mixer. It is associated with optimizing the layout design for the PMD, which will be presented and discussed in this paper, too. PMD test chips have been realized in CMOS technology. Some simulation and first test results of the chip are also presented. The simulation results prove the operation principle of the PMD and provide us with parameters for an optimized layout design. First experimental results verified the expected operation principle of the test PMD.},

	abstract = {Transient images help to analyze light transport in scenes. Besides two spatial dimensions, they are resolved in time of flight. Cost-efficient approaches for their capture use amplitude modulated continuous wave lidar systems but typically take more than a minute of capture time. We propose new techniques for measurement and reconstruction of transient images, which drastically reduce this capture time. To this end, we pose the problem of reconstruction as a trigonometric moment problem. A vast body of mathematical literature provides powerful solutions to such problems. In particular, the maximum entropy spectral estimate and the Pisarenko estimate provide two closed-form solutions for reconstruction using continuous densities or sparse distributions, respectively. Both methods can separate m distinct returns using measurements at m modulation frequencies. For m = 3 our experiments with measured data confirm this. Our GPU-accelerated implementation can reconstruct more than 100000 frames of a transient image per second. Additionally, we propose modifications of the capture routine to achieve the required sinusoidal modulation without increasing the capture time. This allows us to capture up to 18.6 transient images per second, leading to transient video. An important byproduct is a method for removal of multipath interference in range imaging.},

By connecting time of flight measurements with theory from arraysignal processing we conclude that performance depends on two primaryfactors: camera modulation frequency and the width of the specular lobe(“shininess”) of the wall. For purely Lambertian walls, commodity time offlight sensors achieve resolution on the order of meters between targets. Forseemingly diffuse walls, such as posterboard, the resolution is drasticallyreduced, to the order of ten centimeters. In particular, we find that the re-lationship between reflectance and resolution is nonlinear—a slight amountof shininess can lead to a dramatic improvement in resolution. Since manyrealistic scenes exhibit a slight amount of shininess we believe that off-the-shelf ToF cameras can look around corners.},
